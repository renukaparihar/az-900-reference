Azure Security Center is a best practice analyzer for Azure resources and on-premises resources.

Security Center covers three primary areas: policy and compliance, resource security hygiene, and threat protection.

Just-in-time VM access can restrict VM remote desktop access to certain networks and certain times of day.

Azure Key Vault provides a secure way to store secrets, keys, and certificates.

Azure Key Vault Premium tier stores keys in hardware security modules (HSMs), making it FIPS 140-2–compliant.

Azure Sentinel is a solution for implementing SOAR and SIEM in an environment.

Sentinel can help watch for security threats in Azure, other clouds, and on-premises.

Sentinel can take an action on a security alert using Playbooks, and Playbooks are built on top of Azure Logic Apps.

Azure Dedicated Host allows you to host your VMs on a dedicated host computer.

Azure Dedicated Host uses a host group to contain the dedicated host computers running your VMs.

Defense in depth is also often called the “castle approach” because it represents multi-layered security strategies.

Network Security Groups (NSGs) are rules that allow you to filter traffic on a network and control that traffic.

NSG rules have a priority between 100 and 4,096, and rules with a lower priority number take precedence.

Azure Firewall denies all traffic into specific subnets unless a rule is configured to allow that traffic.

Azure Firewall is a stateful firewall that “remembers” the state of connections. This allows it to recognize malicious traffic that might otherwise seem normal.

Azure DDoS Protection comes in two tiers: Basic and Standard.

Basic is free and refers to the DDoS protection that Microsoft has in place to prevent Azure from being impacted by DDoS attacks.

Standard can be used alongside Azure Application Gateway.
