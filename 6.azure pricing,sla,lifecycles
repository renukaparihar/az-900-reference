Primary factors that affect costs are the resource type, how you purchase resources, the Azure regions you use, and the billing zone your resources are in.

Azure services are billed according to meters associated with the resource.

Purchasing an Enterprise Agreement or purchasing from a cloud solution partner (CSP) can save you money on Azure services.

Microsoft’s costs vary by region, and yours will, too.

Azure regions are broken out into billing zones, and you’re charged differently based upon the zone.

The pricing calculator helps you to figure out expenses in Azure by providing a cost estimate based on the resources you need.

The total cost of ownership calculator allows you to enter details on your on-premises resources. It then provides an estimate of how much you can save by moving to the cloud.

Azure Cost Management allows you to analyze your costs at a granular level.

Cost Management allows you to create a budget and configure alerts based on that budget.

An SLA is a guarantee from Microsoft for uptime of a service.

SLAs often have configuration requirements that must be met. These are documented on the service’s SLA web page.

A service is only considered outside SLA if an availability problem happens because of something that is within Microsoft’s control.

Preview services are offered in advance of production release and often have no SLA. They’re also usually offered at a discount.

When a service is ready for production use, it’s declared to be generally available and carries an SLA.
